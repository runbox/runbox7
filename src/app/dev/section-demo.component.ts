        <p>This is the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) configuration screen, where you can configure the various options for enabling and using 2FA.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> For security reasons, enabling 2FA disables your account password for non-web services. These include IMAP, POP, and SMTP (for email programs/apps), FTP (for file transfer programs/apps), and CalDAV (for calendar programs/apps). Therefore you will need to set up App Passwords for these services if you want to use them.</p>
        <p><strong>Unlock code:</strong> We recommended that you create an unlock code. This special code can be used to disable 2FA if you have problems logging in with your 2FA codes.</p>
