  <br>Building the fastest webmail app on the planet<br><br>
</h4>

Welcome to the Runbox 7 project!

Runbox 7 is a next generation webmail app that combines the instant experience of email clients with the versatility of web browsers.

The app is written in Angular 2+ and HTML5 Canvas, using a Perl backend with MySQL storage.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the Runbox 7 App up and running on your local machine, using the Runbox production servers as backend. You can then develop and test changes to the app with a live Runbox account.

### Prerequisites

To run Runbox 7 you first need to install:
* Node.js
* npm
* Git

Installation instructions for Node and NPM:
* Ubuntu 18.04: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18-04)
* OS X: [http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
* Windows: [https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
### Installation

1. Clone the codebase onto your system: `git clone https://github.com/runbox/runbox7.git`
1. Change directory into the repository directory: `cd runbox7`
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`


## Development with your Runbox account (using production servers as backend)

Get started with frontend development without setting up any server, by using the Runbox production servers as backend.

In your repository directory, simply run:

`npm start`

Then open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in a browser and log in with your Runbox account.

To acquire a Runbox account, simply [sign up](https://runbox.com/signup) for a free 30-day trial account. If you would like to contribute to the Runbox 7 project longer term, contact us either via Github or [Runbox Support](https://support.runbox.com) with you username and you can get a complimentary Runbox account for development purposes.

## Development with Mock server

For the E2E tests there is a [Mock Server](e2e/mockserver) that you can also use in development.

To start the server type:

`npm run mockserver`

And then from another terminal you can start the Angular app using the mockserver as backend by typing:

`npm run start-use-mockserver`

## Development with your own server installation

Run `npm run appdev` and you will be able to access Runbox 7 at `https://yourvm/appdev`.

This option requires the full Runbox backend, which is not yet open source.

## Development server with proxy

By default running `npm start` will use the production environment at https://runbox.com as backend. If you want to use another backend you may change the `RUNBOX7_ANGULAR_BACKEND_HOST` environment variable.

Run `RUNBOX7_ANGULAR_BACKEND_HOST=https://yourvm.runbox.com npm start` to use the backend of your choice.
    
You may then access the Angular app at: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## Creating production bundles

Run `npm run build`. Production bundles will be created in the `dist` folder and is ready
to be copied into the production web servers.

## No-script

If you use no-script, remember to whitelist localhost to execute localhost.

## Code scaffolding

Example creating a new module and a component:

`ng generate module --project runbox7 xapian/SearchExpressionBuilder`

followed by
`ng generate component --project runbox7 xapian/SearchExpressionBuilder`

This resulted in the module `xapian/search-expression-builder/search-expression-builder.module.ts` which also imported the component.

And this is from the standard @angular/cli docs:

Run `ng generate component --project runbox7 component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Development

Depending on what type of development you wish to do, you may want to set up a Runbox trial account to avoid affecting data stored in your own Runbox account.
